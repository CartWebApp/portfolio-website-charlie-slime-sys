                    This assignment gave me a brief of how well I’m able to portray emotion. It allowed me to study how to absorb myself into the writing 
                    to allow myself a way to branch out how characters act. It served as a way to help me learn character emotion.

                    This particular writing project is a display of my current writing skills. I collaborated with a project partner to get this story up and running. 
                    I wanted to figure out how to write out characters that have no particular build to them, only in personality. This means, I didn’t dive into any background 
                    of the character, nor did I bother having too much detail in their reactions. It was experimental by writing as if it were in an actual book.
