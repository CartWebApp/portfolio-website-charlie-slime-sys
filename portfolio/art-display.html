                    All the way back in 2019, I drew a photo of a cat falling into the water digitally. It was inspired by the song MAYDAY by TheFatRat, 
                    taken by the idea of endlessly drifting into the deep blue seas. Now in 2025, I’ve drawn it to display how much I’ve actually improved 
                    over the years. This project helped further my creative process, understanding what it was like in the past, and developing it into 
                    something I can use for the future.

                    This reference sheet is a representation of how I can design characters based off of a prompt, or simply off of my imagination. 
                    I have spent hours pouring energy into figuring out fundamentals of character design, and I’ve helped give my characters more 
                    interesting appearances. However, I do have the space and time to improve, as my skills have gotten better over time.
