                    I am an experienced artist with a diverse background in various fields, including traditional art,
                    digital art, and music. Art is my passion, and I’m eager to share that spark by teaching others, so
                    they can experience the joy of creativity as well. I value my work above all else and strive to
                    improve every day.

                    As an artist with ADHD, my hyperfixations often drive my creativity forward. Over the years, I’ve
                    developed many interests and explored various fandoms, which have influenced my character designs
                    and original artworks. I’ve gained a range of skills and achievements that I’d love to share with
                    everyone.
