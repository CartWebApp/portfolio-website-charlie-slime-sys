                    I’m an artist! I love to draw a lot of things, ranging from things I’m interested in, original characters,
                    all the way to landscaping and portraits. Art is really the one thing I’ve found myself to be really good at,
                    and I take pride in that. I strive to improve every day. There’s never a day I don’t draw unless I'm overbearingly busy.
                    Genuinely, this hobby brings me so much joy that I don’t think I could live without it.

                    I started playing the cello all the way back in 2021. Being a cellist is what I wanted to do back in elementary school,
                    but because I didn’t get that chance, I delayed by being a violist, and I eventually got to pursue my dreams after my family
                    got the funds to allow me to attend private lessons. Being a cellist is fun, and I love performing on stage for others to see.
                    Not so much regarding soloing all the time, but I do love playing with a group, or orchestra. Music is my passion alongside
                    art, and I want to bring joy to others, as much as I do with my art.

                    Writing is more so my creative interest, and nothing that ever required much passion to get into.
                    I found out I was actually pretty good at writing, so as a kid I wrote short stories for myself and created
                    original characters that I’ve evolved over the future. I usually write in my spare time, just to get random
                    thoughts out of my head.
