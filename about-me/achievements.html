                    I started this endeavor all the way back in elementary school, starting from Viola in 2017 to cello
                    starting 2021. I’ve performed around 28 concerts, excluding any of my recital concerts that I’ve had
                    for my private lessons. I’ve been first chair with both instruments, and I’ve been recognized for my
                    hard work of improvement in 2023-24.

                    In 2020, I manifested an idea with my older sibling, Griffyn, to own a shop together. By then, my
                    brand username SquirrelsRainyDay was born, and Funrockz Drawiingz came into place. We unfortunately
                    don’t make much, but this experience has taught me how to finance my art supplies to spread my art
                    around. I’m still local, but I have aspirations to branch out and actually open my shop online when
                    I have the chance.

                    I started my journey with art about 10 years ago. Over time, I’ve taught myself how to draw,
                    including any techniques I picked up along the way. I’ve been recognized by any art teachers I’ve
                    come across for my hard work and dedication, as they’ve pushed me forward to meet my goals in life.
                    I’ve made steady progress, and the first digital piece I really made was back in 2020.
