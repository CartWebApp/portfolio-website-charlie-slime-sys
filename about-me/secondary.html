                <p class="font-two">
                    My plan after college is to become an art teacher, as I am passionate about sharing my love for art with others
                    and inspiring the next generations of creativity after me. However, I also recognize the importance of financial stability.
                </p>
                <p class="font-two">
                    To ensure I can support myself and my household, I intend to major in music as well as education and general arts.
                    This will allow me to take on gig work on the side, providing an additional source of income.
                </p>
                <p class="font-two">
                    As both an artist and a musician, I have the opportunity to accept commissions and requests. This not only gives my art portfolio
                    more content but also adds to my earnings, depending on how frequently I receive commissions. By pursuing music alongside my teaching endeavors,
                    I can safely sleep on the fear of becoming a "starving artist" and build a more secure future for myself.
                </p>
                <p class="font-two">
                    Balancing these roles will enable me to thrive both personally and professionally while doing what I love the most in my life.
